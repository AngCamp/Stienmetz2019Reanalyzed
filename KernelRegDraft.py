"""
We need to first reun CCA to generate B then we want to find the matrix a 
(also denoted as a matrix W with vectors w_n for each neruon n).  CCA
is first run from the toeplitz matrix of diagonalized kernel functions this will reduce
the dimensionality of the entire time course, we then optimize the weights of the components of 
this reduced representation.  Minimizations of square error is done by elastic net regularizatuion applied
on a neuron by neuron basis.  

Currently has matlab code sprinkled in comments to guide development.

Eventually the goal is to turn this into a .ipyn file, the all caps comments
are notes which denote sections, multi line commebts are quotes from the paper
which will be included or written up for description of the workflow.

##Going from neurons across all regions and mice

# Which neurons to include
"""
clusters._phy_annotation.npy [enumerated type] (nClusters) 0 = noise (these are already
excluded and don't appear in this dataset at all); 1 = MUA 
(i.e. presumed to contain spikes from multiple neurons; these are not analyzed 
 in any analyses in the paper); 2 = Good (manually labeled); 3 = Unsorted. In 
this dataset 'Good' was applied in a few but not all datasets to included neurons, 
so in general the neurons with _phy_annotation>=2 are the ones that should be included.
"""

#So we should apply the criteria we want and search the data that way.

#when querrying the clusters data we can apply the quality score criteria



# first we want trial times since we are initially only going to look at
# data withing the trial times, may as well collect the data we need from them
# for feeding into toeplitz matrix later

"""
A NOTE ON THE TIMESTAMP FILES AND LFP DATA

So each session contains a few files named like this:
    'Forssmann_2017-11-01_K1_g0_t0.imec.lf.timestamps.npy'
    
    These are the time base offsets for the probes internal clocks.  In order
to align the time base here for the events occuring in the trials to the LFP
you will need to account for these.  They bear no relevance for the spikes,
stimuli, movement etc etc these are set to the same time base which starts 
prior to the begining of the trials.

def stats_filter(session, threshold):    
    """
        Here we test for the first 4 critieria used in the publication, basically
        if a neurons passes these at a threshold of 0.05.  Despite doing 4 tests
        a neurons transientyl firing would be excluded so this threshold was
        chosen instead.
        
        We autopass neurons that passed an earlier test.
        
        According to Steinmetz et al. (2019) neurons were further tested before
        inclusion in the kernel regression...
        '...a set of six statistical tests were used to detect changes in activity

The Methods section Data Analysis describes a battery of criteria that are needed, 
read in detail

- remeber to check the quality scores of the neurons online it says not to include 
any neuron below a 2 I think, please double check this.
-other filtering methods were applied but below is the list of criteria we will need to apply
ourselves

To determine whether a neuronâ€™s firing rate was significantly modulated during the task 
(Supplementary Fig. 1), a set of six statistical tests were used to detect changes in activity 
during various task epochs and conditions: (1) Wilcoxon sign-rank test between trial firing rate 
(rate of spikes between stimulus onset and 400 ms post-stimulus) and baseline rate (defined in 
period âˆ’0.2 to 0 s relative to stimulus onset on each trial); (2) sign-rank test between 
stimulus-driven rate (firing rate between 0.05 and 0.15 s after stimulus onset) and baseline rate;
 (3) sign-rank test between pre-movement rates (âˆ’0.1 to 0.05 s relative to movement onset) and 
 baseline rate (for trials with movements); (4) Wilcoxon rank-sum test between pre-movement rates
  on left choice trials and those on right choice trials; (5) sign-rank test between post-movement 
  rates (âˆ’0.05 to 0.2 s relative to movement onset) and baseline rate; (6) rankâ€“sum test between 
  post-reward rates (0 to 0.15 s relative to reward delivery for correct NoGos) and baseline rates.
   A neuron was considered active during the task, or to have detectable modulation during some part
    of the task, if any of the P values on these tests were below a Bonferroni-corrected alpha value
     (0.05/6 = 0.0083). However, because the tests were coarse and would be relatively insensitive
      to neurons with transient activity, a looser threshold was used to determine the neurons
       included for statistical analyses (Figs. 3â€“5): if any of the first four tests (that is,
        those concerning the period between stimulus onset and movement onset) had a P value less
         than 0.05.

In determining the neurons statistically significantly responding during different task conditions 
(Figs. 2dâ€“h, right sub-panels, 5b), the mean firing rate in the post-stimulus window (0 to 0.25 s), 
taken across trials of the desired condition, was z-scored relative to trial-by-trial baseline rates
 (from the window âˆ’0.1 to 0) and taken as significant when this value was >4 or <âˆ’4, equivalent to
  a two-sided t-test at P < 10âˆ’4.

For visualizing firing rates (Extended Data Fig. 4), the activity of each neuron was then binned
 at 0.005 s, smoothed with a causal half-Gaussian filter with standard deviation 0.02 s, averaged 
 across trials, smoothed with another causal half-Gaussian filter with standard deviation 0.03 s, 
 baseline subtracted (baseline period âˆ’0.02 to 0 s relative to stimulus onset, including all trials
  in the task), and divided by baseline + 0.5 spikes sâˆ’1. Neurons were selected for display if they
   had a significant difference between firing rates on trials with both stimuli and movements 
   versus trials with neither, using a sliding window 0.1 s wide and in steps of 0.005 s 
   (rank-sum P < 0.0001 for at least three consecutive bins).
