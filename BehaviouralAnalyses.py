The purpose of this script is to analyze the behaviour of the animals specifically looking for effects described
in Lak et al., (2020) as well as Akrami et al., (2018).  The behaviour in described how previous reinforcement of correct trials results in the
choice of a particular stimuli on hard trials.  We can easilt train and estimate such effects for mice.

 Espescially relevant is extended data 6 where they describe other models to the one they found was the best fit.
